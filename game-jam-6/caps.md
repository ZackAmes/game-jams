# Project Name

### Submission Track
Full Game

### Project Summary
Caps is a fast paced chess like board game where your pieces have special abilities. There are 4 teams to choose from with a variety of playstyles, as well as elo based matchmaking and a daydreams agent to play against.

### GitHub
https://github.com/ZackAmes/caps-jam

### Play
Just sign in and either queue up or select play agent. There is also an invite feature that i haven't tested at all but should work. 
Try getting in the queue and playing the agent while you wait for a match. If the agent isn't working or you just want to play against a person feel free to reach to me as well.
